# Project Automation Web

Hi! This is a project automation web with study case [Bioskop Indonesia](https://bioskoponline.com/) using Maven, Cucumber, TestNG, and Selenium

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Intermezzo

**TestNG** is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

* Annotations.
  ( Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
  ( Test that your code is multithreading safe.
* Flexible test configuration.
* Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
* Support for parameters.
* Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
* Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).
* Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
* Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
* Dependent methods for application server testing.

TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:  unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc...
